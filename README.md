# Sensors

## Serverless function apps on Azure 

I developed a serverless application to fit a given scenario - N sensors placed
aroud Leeds sending data to a central endpoint, which needed to request,
aggregate and analyse the data. This provided valuable experience with Azure
and an insight into how real-world serverless applications function.

About this project:

- Designed database schemas in Transact-SQL to suit the problem, storing data
  and analysis results appropriately. These were put into use on a dedicated
  Azure SQL server that I configured and managed.
- Designed, developed, configured and maintained Azure function apps using the
  v2 Python Azure programming model.
